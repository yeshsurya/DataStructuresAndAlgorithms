<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<h2>Merge Sort</h2>
<p>Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.Strategy is to recursively break till we see smaller atomic components of the array under consideration and we start merging as per the sort order.As we are breaking half at every point there will be decaying exponential of factor 2 steps, i.e log base 2 n steps involved in breakage.This summed n times the wrost case compute complexity is O(n*logn)</p>

<h2>Radix Sort</h2>

<h2>Quick Sort</h2>
<p>Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.In place divide and conqur algorithm with comparitive strategy.At every level of function call we partition step which ensures number maginitude order. Every we are breaking at decayed exponential way we move throgh all elements to reach sort.Hence the worst case complexity of the algorithm is order of n squared.</p>
