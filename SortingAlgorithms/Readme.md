<h2>Merge Sort</h2>
<p>Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.Strategy is to recursively break till we see smaller atomic components of the array under consideration and we start merging as per the sort order.As we are breaking half at every point there will be decaying exponential of factor 2 steps, i.e log base 2 n steps involved in breakage.This summed n times the wrost case compute complexity is O(n*logn)</p>
